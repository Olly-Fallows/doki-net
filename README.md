# Monika

### Abstract

Monika is an experimental ML library I(Oliver Fallows) am developing. Monika uses a NEAT neural network structure, meaning that the number of neurons in Monika's networks can change throughout training allowing for more efficient solutions. Monika is optimised using the GAN technique meaning that there is always 2 networks that are the result of the same training.

### Dependencies

I have tried to keep Monika as self dependent as possible but there are some dependencies, found listed below in two categories.

Just using Monika:
 - Node.js
 - npm

Compiling/Developing on Monika:
 - All listed for using Monika
 - bash/equivalent shell
 - gcc compiler

### Calling ANN, RNN and CNN
